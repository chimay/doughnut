WHAT IS IT					*wheel-introduction-what*

Wheel is a navigation plugin for Vim or Neovim. It makes abundant use
of special buffers, in which you can filter and select elements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUFFER GROUPS				*wheel-introduction-buffer-groups*

Wheel let you organize your buffers by creating as many buffer groups as
you need, add the buffers you want to it and quickly navigate between :

- Buffers of the same group
- Buffer groups

Note that :

- A location contains a name, a filename, as well as a line & column number
- A buffer group, in fact a location group, is called a circle
- A set of buffer groups is called a torus (a circle of circles)
- The list of toruses is called the wheel

Why do you need three levels of grouping ?~

At first glance, managing groups with circles in a torus seems to
be sufficient. But with time, the torus grows big, and a third level
helps you to organize your files by groups and categories:

  - The wheel contains all the toruses
  - Each torus contains a category of files, e.g.:
    + configuration, development, publication
  - Each circle contains a project, e.g.:
    + emacs or vifm circles in configuration torus
    + shell or elisp in development torus
    + tea or art in publication torus

A wheel that follows you~
    ~
Wheel is designed to follow your workflow : you only add the files
you want, where you want. For instance, if you have a `organize` group
with agenda & todo files, you can quickly alternate them, or display
them in two windows. Then, if you suddenly got an idea to tune vim,
you switch to the `vim` group with your favorites configuration files in
it. Same process, to cycle, alternate or display the files. Over time,
your groups will grow and adapt to your style.

HISTORY						*wheel-introduction-history*

This project is inspired by :

- ctrlspace : https://github.com/vim-ctrlspace/vim-ctrlspace, a similar
  plugin for Vim

- unite : https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim and its successor denite
  (Shougo/denite.nvim), a search plugin for arbitrary sources

- torus : https://github.com/chimay/torus, a similar plugin for Emacs,
  itself inspired by MTorus

- quickfix-reflector : https://github.com/stefandtw/quickfix-reflector.vim,

STEP BY STEP						*wheel-step-by-step*

Prefix				|wheel-sbs-prefix|
One map to ring them all	|wheel-sbs-one-map-to-ring-them-all|
First circles			|wheel-sbs-first-circles|
Moving around			|wheel-sbs-moving-around|
Square the circle		|wheel-sbs-square-the-circle|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX						*wheel-sbs-prefix*

In the following discussion, I assume that you have kept the default
mapping prefix : >

 let g:wheel_config.prefix = '<M-w>'
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ONE MAP TO RING THEM ALL		*wheel-sbs-one-map-to-ring-them-all*

To get an overview of the Wheel, I suggest you take a look at the main
menu. Press `<M-w>m` and a new buffer will appear, listing the actions
you can perform. Insert mode is used to filter the lines. Press enter
in normal mode to trigger an action (if you know what you’re doing),
or `q` to quit the menu.

If you prefer the meta menu leading you to thematic sub-menus, you can
launch it with `<M-w>=`.

To learn more about menus, see |wheel-special-buffers-menus|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIRST CIRCLES				    	    *wheel-sbs-first-circles*

Let’s say we have the files `Juice`, `Tea`, `Coffee` and we want to
group them. So, we go to `Juice` and type `<M-w>a` to add a location to
the wheel. If no category (no torus) is present in the wheel, it will
create it and ask for a name. Let’s say we name it `Food`. If no group
(no circle) is found in the torus, it will be created and prompt for a
name. Let’s say we choose `Drinks`. Finally, our file `Juice` is added
to the group. Its name is the filename without extension by default.

Then, we go to `Tea` and type `<M-w>a` again. This time, it will just
ask us if we want to keep the default location name. Press enter, and
`Tea` is added to the `Drinks` group.

Same process with `Coffee`. We now have a circle `Drink` containing
three files.

Now, suppose that in the `Juice` file, you have a Pineapple
and a Mango sections, and you want to compare them. Just go to
the Pineapple section, and use `<M-w>a`. It will add the location
`Juice:pineapple-line:pineapple-col` to the current circle. Then, go to
the Mango section, and do the same. The `Juice:mango-line:mango-col`
will also be added to the circle. You can then easily alternate both,
or display them in split windows.

If you want to create another group (circle), let’s say `Fruits`,
simply launch `<M-w><C-a>`, and answer `Fruits` to the prompt. You can
then add the files `Apple`, `Pear` and `Orange` to it. You can even also
add `Juice`: a file can be added to more than one circle.

If you want to create another category (torus), let’s say `Books`,
simply launch `<M-w><S-a>`, and answer `Books` to the prompt.

What happens if you have a lot of files ? Let's say the `novels`
folder, located in the current directory, contains dozen of novels
in plain text format. You can add all of them at once with the
`add_glob` function. Press `<M-w>*` and wheel will ask you to enter a
glob pattern. You can answer `novels/*` to add all files in there. If
there are more levels of subdirs and you want to include all of them,
you can enter `novels/**/*` instead. Then, it will ask if you want to
add the files in a new circle. You can answer yes and call this circle
`Novels`. And voilà, your new `Novels` group contain all the files in
the `novels` folder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MOVING AROUND					     *wheel-sbs-moving-around*

Cycling~

You can cycle the files of a circle with `<M-w><Left>` and
`<M-w><Right>`. These are often used bindings, so I suggest you map them
to more convenient keys, like `<C-PageUp>` and `<C-PageDown>`. See
|wheel-mappings-level-10|.

To cycle the circles, use `<M-w><C-Left>` and `<M-w><C-Right>`. You can
also map them to more convenient keys, like `<C-Home>` and `<C-End>`.

To cycle the toruses, use `<M-w><S-Left>` and `<M-w><S-Right>` or
map them to `<S-Home>` and `<S-End>`.

Switch using completion~

You can switch :

- location with completion with `<M-w><Enter>`
- circle with completion with `<M-w><C-Enter>`
- torus with completion with `<M-w><S-Enter>`

Switch using a special buffer~

You can also switch location, circle or torus by chosing it in a wheel
navigation buffer. See |wheel-special-buffers-navigation|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQUARE THE CIRCLE				*wheel-sbs-square-the-circle*

Over time, the number of circles will grow. Completion is great,
but if you just want to alternate the two last locations in history,
you’ll probably prefer `<M-w>^`. A  menu will appear and offer you
these alternate variants :

- Alternate anywhere
- Alternate in the same circle
- Alternate in the same torus
- Alternate in another circle
- Alternate in another torus
- Alternate in same torus but another circle

You can also use the meta or main menu.

I strongly suggest you map a convenient key, like `<C-^>`, to
`<plug>(wheel-alternate-anywhere)`, it’s one of the most often binding
you will use. See |wheel-mappings-level-10| for more informations.

A common case is to alternate two files in the same circle, and two
circles in the same torus. So, you have the square :

 Alternate    | File 1	        | File 2
--------------|-----------------|-----------------
Circle Drinks | Juice           | Tea
Circle Fruits | Apple           | Pear

at your fingertips.

INTRODUCTION				*wheel-special-buffers-introduction*

Special buffers allow you to perform Wheel operations intuitively, using
full power of your editor : search, yank, paste, completion, and so on.

The available actions depend on the buffer type :

- Menu buffers allow you to launch a wheel function
- Navigation buffers allow you to switch to a :
  + location, circle or torus
  + MRU file, locate file
  + grep result
  + and so on
- Reordering buffers allow you to reorder locations, circles or toruses
- Reorganize buffer allows you fine grain operations
  + Move, copy or delete locations, circles and toruses, using folds
  + Change locations settings like name, line, col
  + Be sure you know what you’re doing
- Reorganize tabs and windows

Mandala~

A mandala is a synonym for a wheel special buffer.

Wrapping up things~

In normal mode, the keys `j`/`k` and `<up>`/`<down>` wrap the buffer :

- If on the first line, `k` or `<up>` will go to the last line
- If on the last line, `j` or `<down>` will go to the first line

Filtering~

In most special buffers, the first line is left empty : it is used as
an input line to filter the buffer. You can go to insert mode and filter
the elements with each word you enter on the input (first) line. Typing
`<space>`, `<esc>` or `<enter>` will update the candidates. Note that `<C-c>`
is not mapped, in case you need to go to normal mode without triggering
the filter function.

A space between two words is a logical and. So, `one two` will
display lines containing both `one` and `two`.

A pipe `|` in the middle of a word is a logical or. So, `one|two` will
display lines containing `one` or `two`.

A bang `!` beginning a filtering word is a logical not : all lines matching
this word will be removed from the buffer.

Input history~

An input history is available in insert mode. You can insert the
previous/next input with `<Up>`/`<Down>` or `<M-p>`/`<M-n>`.

The keys `<PageUp>`/`PageDown` or `<M-r>`/`<M-s>` will insert the
previous/next input matching the beginning of the inserted line, until
the cursor.

Action~

The main keys are :

- `<enter>` : trigger the default action, close the special buffer
- `g<enter>` : trigger the default action, leave the special buffer opened

Select entries~

Some special buffers will act on selected entries. You can hit :

- `<space>` to toggle the selection of a line
- `&` to invert the selection of all visible lines
- `*` to select all visible lines
- `|` to clear the selection of all visible lines

Reload~

Press `r` and the special buffer will reload its content.

Available on most special buffers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAYER STACK				*wheel-special-buffers-layers*

Each time you launch a wheel function involving a special buffer, a new
associated layer is added to a stack local to the buffer. You may see it
as a kind of special buffer history. You can :

- go back to the previous layer (and associated wheel function) by pressing `H`
- go forward to the next layer by pressing `L`
- destroy current layer and go back to the previous one by pressing `<backspace>`

The maximum size of the layer stack is determined by `g:wheel_config.maxim.layers`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUFFERS STACK				*wheel-special-buffers-stack*

Wheel manages a special buffers stack. You can :

- Save your current special buffer with `<M-w><Tab>`
  + A new special buffer will be the default one for the wheel functions
- Cycle the special buffers with `<M-w>@` (left) or `<M-w><M-@>` (right)
- Remove the current special buffer with `<M-w><Backspace>`
  + It is removed from the stack and wiped from vim buffers

So, there are two stack levels :

- a layer stack in each special buffer
- a buffer stack

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MENU BUFFERS				*wheel-special-buffers-menus*

Each menu has its own dedicated special buffer. You can filter the menu
lines by entering words in insert mode.

Action~

In menu buffers, `<tab>` is a synonym for `<enter>` : trigger action.

Since there is no need to select multiple elements, `<space>` is a
shortcut for `g<enter>` : launch action and leave the menu opened.

Main menu~

The main menu is triggered with `<M-w>m` by default. From there, you
can launch the action you want by pressing `<enter>` on its line. Same
thing for `g<enter>`, but it will leave the special buffer opened.

The available actions are grouped by themes and folded. Just open a fold to
access its content.

Meta menu~

Press `<M-w>=` to open the meta menu : each line in this buffer will
launch a sub-menu. Each sub-menu holds the actions of the same category :

- Add a new element to the wheel
- Rename an element
- Delete an element
- Alternate last two elements
- Display elements in tabs
- Display elements in windows
- Display elements in tabs & windows
- Reorganize elements
- Navigation
- Search in files
- Run a command and collect its output
- Paste from yank wheel

In these sub-menus, you can use the keys :

- `<enter>`             : launch the action on the cursor line
- `g<enter>`, `<space>`   : launch action and leave the menu opened
- `<backspace>`         : leads you back to the meta menu

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTEXT MENUS				*wheel-special-buffers-context*

Some special buffers have context menu support. In that case, pressing
`<tab>` will open a menu where you can choose the action you want to
apply to the selected or cursor line(s).

If you change your mind and wish to come back, just press `<backspace>`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAVIGATION BUFFERS			*wheel-special-buffers-navigation*

The navigation buffers allow you to quickly switch to a Wheel location
by pressing `<enter>` on the matching line. The buffer will be opened
in previous used window. You can also use the keys :

- `t` : open buffer in a new tab
- `s` : open buffer in a new split
- `v` : open buffer in a new vsplit
- `S` : open buffer in a new split with golden ratio
- `V` : open buffer in a new vsplit with golden ratio

Same keys as above, but leave the navigation buffer opened :

- `g<enter>` : same as `<enter>`
- `gt` : same as `t`
- `gs` : same as `s`
- `gv` : same as `v`
- `gS` : same as `S`
- `gV` : same as `V`

The navigation buffers also have context menus support.
See |wheel-special-buffers-context|.

Mappings~

The default mappings launching navigation buffers are :

- `<M-w><Space>`   : switch to location
- `<M-w><C-space>` : switch to current location of the chosen circle
- `<M-w><S-space>` : switch to current location of the chosen torus
- `<M-w>x`         : index of toruses > circles > locations
- `<M-w><C-x>`     : index of toruses > circles
- `<M-w><M-x>`     : index with folds (see below)
- `<M-w>h`         : history index
- `<M-w><M-b>`     : switch to buffer (opened file)
- `<M-w><M-m>`     : most recently used files not found in wheel (mru)
- `<M-w><M-l>`     : search files with `locate`
- `<M-w><M-f>`     : search files with `find` in async mode
- `<M-w>v`         : switch to visible buffer in tab & window (plain mode)
- `<M-w><M-v>`     : switch to visible buffer in tab & window (tree fold mode)
- `<M-w><M-s>`     : occur in current file
- `<M-w><M-g>`     : grep in circle files
- `<M-w><M-o>`     : outline headers in circle files
- `<M-w><M-t>`     : tags
- `<M-w>j`         : jumps list
- `<M-w>c`         : changes list

Menus~

The navigation buffers can also be launched from the main & meta menus.

Folding~

The map `<M-w><M-x>` opens a dedicated buffer where folds are used to
reflect the tree structure of the Wheel : toruses, circles and locations.

Filtering in that buffer will keep surrounding folds ; only non mathing
empty folds will be removed.

Similarly, the map `<M-w><M-t>` opens a dedicated buffer where folds
are used to reflect the tree structure of tabs and windows in (neo)vim.

Selection~

Pressing `<Space>` will toggle the selection of the current line. If a
line is selected, it will begin with an asterisk. You can then open all
selected files in tabs, splits or vertical splits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REORDERING BUFFERS			*wheel-special-buffers-reordering*

The reordering buffers allow you to quickly reorder Wheel elements by
reordering the buffer lines. You can use yank/delete/paste operations to
perform the reordering, or sort them with |:sort|.

Please yank/delete entire lines, or your data could loose their integrity.

To validate your change, simply |:write| the buffer.

The number of lines will be checked and, if there is missing or excedent
lines, Wheel will refuse to apply your change.

Mappings~

The default mappings launching reordering buffers are :

- `<M-w>o`     : reorder locations
- `<M-w><C-o>` : reorder circles
- `<M-w>O`     : reorder toruses

Menus~

The reordering buffers can also be launched from the main & meta menus.

Pressed the wrong button ?~

If something goes wrong, you can quit the buffer and re-read the wheel
variables with `<M-w>r`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REORGANIZING BUFFERS			*wheel-special-buffers-reorganizing*

The reorganizing buffer allows you to quickly reorganize the Wheel
elements. All elements of the wheel are represented, and folds are used
to reflect the tree structure of the Wheel :

- torus names
- circle names
- locations (the dictionary lines)

You can :

- copy or move elements by copying or moving the buffer lines
  + copy or move a location to another circle
  + copy or move a circle to another torus
  + reordering elements (but without check)
- rename elements
- change line or column of a location

Please move or copy entire lines, or your data could loose their
integrity. Be aware that removing a line will remove the corresponding
element from the wheel.

To validate your change, simply |:write| the buffer.

Mappings~

The default mapping is `<M-w><M-r>`.

Menus~

The reorganizing buffer can also be launched from the main & meta menus.

Pressed the wrong button ?~

If something goes wrong, you can quit the buffer and re-read the wheel
variables with `<M-w>r`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REORGANIZE TABS AND WINDOWS		*wheel-special-buffers-reorg-tabwins*

In this buffer, you can :

- add new tabs
- add files in new windows
  + the split will be horizontal or vertical, depending
    on the aspect ratio of the preceding window
- move, copy or delete tabs
- move, copy or delete windows

To validate your change, simply |:write| the buffer.

Mappings~

The default mapping is `<M-w>W`.

Menus~

This buffer can also be launched from the main & meta menus.

From context menu~

This buffer can also be launched from the context menu of a tabs & windows
navigation buffer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GREP BUFFER				*wheel-special-buffers-grep*

The default mapping is `<M-w><M-g>`.

The navigation mappings are the same as usual : activate a buffer line
will open the right file at the right place.

Context menu~

The context menu contains :

- the usual navigation functionalities
- an edit mode
- a quickfix window opener

The edit mode will save your search and open a new buffer where you can
edit the grep lines. If you write this buffer, the plugin will propagate
your changes to the grepped file(s). There are some limitations, however :

- you cannot add or remove entire lines
- if you exchange or shuffle lines, they will be exchanged or shuffled in your
  files too, which can lead to an undesired mess.

Note that :

- the plugin will not write the grepped files for you.
- you can of course undo the changes you made if you are not happy with it

Anyway, it's always a good thing to do a backup of your files first,
or even better, to work within a VCS repository, like git.

Outline~

The default mapping is `<M-w><M-o>`.

An outline buffer is a grep buffer where all your headers are displayed. You
can choose between the following header formats :

- vim folds
- markdown
- org mode
- vimwiki

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIND BUFFER				*wheel-special-buffers-find*

Search files with find.

It runs in async mode. You can stop the process by using `<c-s>` in the
special buffer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YANK BUFFER				*wheel-special-buffers-yank*

As usual, you can filter the elements in insert mode.
The available local maps are :

 - `<enter>` : paste a yank after cursor
 - `g<enter>` : paste a yank after cursor, leave yank wheel opened
 - `p` : paste a yank after cursor, leave yank wheel opened
 - `P` : paste a yank before cursor, leave yank wheel opened

List mode~

The yank wheel buffer in list mode is launched by `<M-w>y`.

Each line of the special buffer is one of your yanks, represented as a
list, one element per line.

Plain mode~

The yank wheel buffer in plain mode is launched by `<M-w>p`.

All your yanks are concatenated and displayed in the special buffer.

In normal mode, the paste is done linewise or characterwise, depending
on the mapping used :

 - `p` : paste a yank linewise after cursor, leave yank wheel opened
 - `P` : paste a yank linewise before cursor, leave yank wheel opened
 - `gp` : paste a yank characterwise after cursor, leave yank wheel opened
 - `gP` : paste a yank characterwise before cursor, leave yank wheel opened

Visual mode~

You can also go to visual mode and paste your selection. The paste is
done characterwise.

Menus~

The yank wheel buffers can also be launched from the main & meta menus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BATCH BUFFER				*wheel-special-buffers-batch*

See |wheel-batch-command|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMAND OUTPUT BUFFER			*wheel-special-buffers-command*

You can execute an ex or shell command and display the output in a wheel
special buffer. Shell commands must be prefixed by a `!`.

Default mapping : `<M-w>:`

Examples :

- `<M-w>:` then `nmap <plug>(wheel-`
- `<M-w>:` then `nmap <M-w>`
- `<M-w>:` then `!ls -l % #`

Async mode~

You can run a shell command in async mode and display the output in a
special buffer.

Default mapping : `<M-w>&`

You can stop the process by using `<c-s>` in the special buffer.

==============================================================================
BATCH OPERATIONS				    *wheel-batch-operations*

Batch command			|wheel-batch-command|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BATCH COMMAND					    *wheel-batch-command*

The command : >

 :WheelBatch {my_command}
<

uses the argument list to execute `my_command` on each location of the
current circle. The command can be a vim `:command` or an external shell
`!command`. The ouput is displayed in a dedicated buffer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VIM OPTIONS					*wheel-config-vim-options*

To facilitate the navigation between buffers, the following vim options
can be useful : >

    set hidden
    set bufhidden=hide
<

If you don't want to activate these options, remember to write your
files before using a wheel navigation tool.

To spot the cursor line in other windows while browsing
a |wheel-special-buffers|, you can either :

- activate the |'cursorline'| option
- activate the |'number'| and |'relativenumber'| options,
  and set |hl-CursorLineNr| to a different color than |hl-LineNr|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DICTIONARY					  *wheel-config-dictionary*

Customization is done using the `g:wheel_config` dictionary. You must
first initialize it : >

    let g:wheel_config       = {}
    let g:wheel_config.maxim = {}
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILE						    *wheel-config-file*

File to save or load the wheel : >

    let g:wheel_config.file = '~/.local/share/wheel/auto.vim'
<

Note that the directory `~/.local/share/wheel` must exist.

It is highly recommended to define this file and regularly save it,
either manually or automatically, using the autowrite config.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTOREAD					    *wheel-config-autoread*

Auto read torus file on startup if non null : >

    let g:wheel_config.autoread = 1
<

To enable it, you need to add an autocommand on vim enter : >

  autocmd VimEnter * call wheel#void#init()
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTOWRITE					    *wheel-config-autowrite*

Auto write torus file on exit if non null : >

    let g:wheel_config.autowrite = 1
<

To enable it, you need to add an autocommand on vim leave : >

<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKUPS						    *wheel-config-backups*

Number of backup for the wheel file : >

    let g:wheel_config.backups = 3
<

Assuming your wheel file is `auto.vim`, the backups will be named
`auto.vim.1`, `auto.vim.2`, `auto.vim.3`, and so on.

It is recommended to use backups, in case things get messed up
accidentally.

AUTOCOMMANDS					   *wheel-autocommands*

Auto read			|wheel-autocommands-auto-read|

After jump			|wheel-autocommands-after-jump|
Auto follow			|wheel-autocommands-auto-follow|
Auto update			|wheel-autocommands-auto-update|
MRU files			|wheel-autocommands-mru-files|
Yank wheel			|wheel-autocommands-yank|
Example				|wheel-autocommands-example|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTO READ				*wheel-autocommands-auto-read*

To enable autoread, you need to add an autocommand on vim enter : >

    autocmd VimEnter * call wheel#void#init()
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTO WRITE				*wheel-autocommands-auto-write*

To enable autowrite, you need to add an autocommand on vim leave : >

    autocmd VimLeave * call wheel#void#exit()
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AFTER JUMP				*wheel-autocommands-after-jump*

The user autocommands `WheelAfterJump` are executed at the end of each
navigation operation in the Wheel ; basically, each time you jump to
another file using wheel group functions.

This example fold everything except the cursor line : >

    autocmd User WheelAfterJump norm zMzx
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTO FOLLOW		    		*wheel-autocommands-auto-follow*

If you wish the wheel to auto-follow the buffers you enter, you can add
this autocommand : >

    autocmd BufEnter * call wheel#projection#follow()
<

This means that each time you enter a buffer, the plugin will check if
the filename is in the wheel. If true, it will adjust its state to match
the current file.

It is useful when you search with grep and the quickfix window, or when
you edit a file with a classic vim command.

Be aware that it will update the wheel cursor position of your previous
buffer, which makes sense.

Also note that if the file you edit is not in the wheel, the follow
routine will do nothing.  If you want to edit a file and add it to the
current group (circle), you can use `<plug>(wheel-add-file)`. It is
bound to `<M-w>f` by default.

To edit and add a buffer, you can use `<plug>(wheel-add-buffer)`, bound to
`<M-w>b` by default.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTO UPDATE				*wheel-autocommands-auto-update*

If you want to update your cursor position each time you leave a buffer : >

  autocmd BufLeave * call wheel#vortex#update()
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MRU files				    *wheel-autocommands-mru-files*

If you want to record a list of the files you edited without adding them
to the wheel : >

  autocmd BufRead * call wheel#attic#record()
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YANK WHEEL					*wheel-autocommands-yank*

If you want to record your yanks/delete, you can add this autommand to
your init file : >

 autocmd TextYankPost * call wheel#codex#add()
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE					    *wheel-autocommands-example*

Here is an example of a complete autocommands configuration : >

  " On vim enter, for autoreading
  autocmd VimEnter * call wheel#void#init()
  " On vim leave, for autowriting
  autocmd VimLeave * call wheel#void#exit()
  " Executed after jumping to a location
  autocmd User WheelAfterJump norm zMzx
  " For current wheel location to auto follow buffer change
  autocmd BufEnter * call wheel#projection#follow()
  " Update location line & col before leaving a window
  autocmd BufLeave * call wheel#vortex#update()
  " Add current file to MRU files
  autocmd BufRead * call wheel#attic#record()
  " To record your yanks in the yank wheel
  autocmd TextYankPost * call wheel#codex#add()

USER INTERFACE				*wheel-functions-user-interface*

The functions used as User Interface are listed :

- In the mappings of autoload/wheel/centre.vim
- In the menus of autoload/wheel/crystal.vim

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASYNC PROCESS					*wheel-functions-async-process*

wheel#wave#start({command}, {settings})		*wheel-wave-start*
	Neovim only.
	Start an async command and display its output in a special buffer.
	You can filter buffer content, as usual.
	{settings} is a dictionary containing the following keys :
	- new_buffer : whether to open a special buffer
	  before launching the process (true by default)

wheel#ripple#start({command}, {settings})		*wheel-ripple-start*
	Vim only.
	Same as |wheel#wave#start|, but for Vim only.

Level 20			|wheel-mappings-level-20|
Other ideas			|wheel-mappings-ideas|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEVELS						    *wheel-mappings-levels*

The mappings are organized in levels :

- Level 0  : basic
- Level 1  : common
- Level 2  : advanced
- Level 10 : non-prefix mappings

If you set the option `g:wheel_config.mappings` to an integer `N`, all
mappings of level less or equal to `N` will be bound to keys. So, the
higher this option, the more mappings available.

E.g., if you set it to 2 : >

    let g:wheel_config.mappings = 2
<
mappings levels 0, 1 and 2 will be available.

Level 1 or 2 is fine for most usages. Level 10 is interesting if you are
looking for ideas of non-prefix mappings. See |wheel-mappings-level-0| and
subsequent for more information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX						    *wheel-mappings-prefix*

Default mappings of levels 0, 1, 2 use a prefix key. This prefix is `<M-w>` by
default. You can customize it : >

    let g:wheel_config.prefix = '<my-wonderful-prefix>'
<

I like to set it to `<D-w>`, but since the `<D-...>` mappings don't seem
to work in terminal or with Gvim, it is not the default. It's working on
Neovim-qt, though : >

    let g:wheel_config.prefix = '<D-w>'
<

In the following discussion, I assume that you have kept the default
`<M-w>` prefix.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIST OF AVAILABLE MAPS			*wheel-mappings-available-maps*

To display the list of available plug mappings, press `<M-w>:`,
then answer : >

    map <Plug>(wheel-
<

to the prompt. You can then browse the plug wheel maps in a special
wheel buffer. It's only a command output collector though, you can't
launch any map from there.

To see mapped keys, you can also use `<M-w>:`, and answer : >

    map <M-w>
<

to the prompt.

You can find all of these in the file `autoload/wheel/centre.vim`,
function `wheel#centre#plugs`. Their names are self explanatory.

Example of key binding using a plug map : >

    nmap <M-m> <Plug>(wheel-menu-main)
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MNEMONIC					*wheel-mappings-mnemonic*

Most mappings respect the following convention :

- prefix + `letter`     : location operation
- prefix + `<C-letter>` : circle operation
- prefix + `<S-letter>` : torus operation
- prefix + `<M-letter>` : alternative operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEVEL 0						*wheel-mappings-level-0*

Menus~

The most important mapping is `<M-w>m` : it launches a menu in a
special buffer, and from there you can trigger all sort of actions on
the Wheel. See |wheel-special-buffers-menu| for more information.

| Prefix + | With default prefix | Action                  |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| m        | <M-w>m              | Main menu               |

Layouts~

You can display all locations of the current circle, one location per
tab or window. Same idea with circles and toruses.

Available layouts are : horizontal or vertical split, main top, main
left, grid.

You can also display one circle per tab, and one location per window, or
one torus per tab and one circle per window.

Note that all layout mappings use the subprefix `z`, so all layout maps begin
with `<M-w>z`.

LEVEL 10					*wheel-mappings-level-10*

The level 10 offers quicker mappings for the most used wheel functions. You
can set the mapping level to 10 to activate them, or adapt them to your taste
and add them to your init file.

COMMANDS					*wheel-commands*

:WheelDashboard					*:WheelDashboard*
	Print information of the current wheel status in the format
	`torus > circle > location`.


:WheelBatch {my_command}		       *:WheelBatch*
	Use the argument list to execute {my_command} on each location of the
	current circle. The command can be a vim `:command` or an external shell
	`!command`. The ouput is displayed in a dedicated buffer.

:WheelAutogroup				       *:WheelAutogroup*
	Autogroup locations of current torus using filename extensions or directories.
	Creates a new torus where each group will occupy a circle.

==============================================================================
EXAMPLES						*wheel-examples*

Display some locations in tabs	    |wheel-examples-locations-in-tabs|
Display vim files in splits	    |wheel-examples-matching-files-in-splits|
Add a tab with a similar file	    |wheel-examples-similar-tab|
Search and replace		    |wheel-examples-search-replace|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISPLAY SOME LOCATIONS IN TABS	    *wheel-examples-locations-in-tabs*

Just press `<M-w><space>` to launch the location navigator, select the
locations you want and press `t`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISPLAY MATCHING FILES IN SPLITS    *wheel-examples-matching-files-in-split*

- `<M-w><space>` to launch the location navigator
- `i` to go to insert mode
- enter the pattern you want
  + e.g. `\.vim$` if all your vim locations end with `.vim`
- `<enter>` to validate the pattern
- `*` to select all the visible (filtered) locations
- `v` to open all selected locations in vertical splits

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADD A TAB WITH A SIMILAR FILE	    *wheel-examples-similar-tab*

- press `<M-w>W` to launch the tabs & windows organizer
- copy the line with the tab you want to duplicate
  + with closed fold, to take the files in it
- paste it where you want
- open the fold of the new tab
- modify the filename in it to match the file you want to edit
  + you can even use `<C-x><C-f>` to use vim file completion
- apply your changes with |:write|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEARCH AND REPLACE		    *wheel-examples-search-replace*

Let's say you want to refactory some shell scripts, and replace
`old_var_name` by `new_var_name`.

The first thing to do is to create a group that contains all of your
scripts. To do that, first create a torus named e.g. `quickfix`. Then,
add all the script files with `<M-w>*`. The routine will ask you the
glob pattern ; you can type `**/*.sh` if all your scripts have the same
`sh` extension. After that, you will be asked if you want to create a
new circle. Answer yes, and call this circle `shell`.

Now that you have your group ready, you can start the search with
`<M-w><M-g>`. It will open the grep special buffer. Hit tab, and launch
the edit mode. You are now in a buffer where you can edit and propagate
your changes. So, we use the classic `:%s/old_var_name/new_var_name/g`
to replace all the occurences of the old var name. Then, just |:write|
the buffer to apply these changes to all your shell scripts.

Want to go back to previous state ? You can undo your substitution in
the special buffer, and write again.

You can of course reuse the `shell` group for later refactoring.
